0x12. JavaScript - Warm up
Background Context
JavaScript is used for many things. Here, you will use JavaScript for 2 reasons:

- Scripting (same as we did with Python)
- Web front-end
- For the moment, and for learning all basic concepts of this language, we will do some scripting. 
  After, we will make our AirBnB project dynamic by using Javascript and JQuery.
